# Components Directory

This directory contains reusable UI components organized by their purpose.

## Structure

- `ui/`: Low-level UI components that are highly reusable across the application
- `layout/`: Components related to page layout and structure
- `data-display/`: Components for displaying data (cards, charts, tables)
- `navigation/`: Navigation-related components (menus, breadcrumbs)
- `theme/`: Theme-related components and providers

## Best Practices

1. Keep components focused on a single responsibility
2. Use named exports for all components
3. Group related components in subdirectories
4. Create index.ts files to simplify imports
5. Document complex components with comments
